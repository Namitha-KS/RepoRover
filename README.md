### Project Description
RepoRover is an AI-driven tool that automatically generates documentation for GitHub repositories. By simply providing a repository link, users can get a comprehensive README file, a detailed project report, and essential assets like system diagrams and GitHub workflow visuals. RepoRover aims to streamline the process of writing technical documentation, especially for developers, saving them time and effort.

### The Problem Statement
Many developers struggle with writing and maintaining comprehensive documentation for their GitHub repositories. RepoRover addresses this by automating the process, making it easier to focus on writing code rather than documentation.

### The Solution
RepoRover uses AI to analyze a GitHub repository and generates a structured README file, project report, and visual assets. It extracts the relevant details like project description, technologies used, and repository structure, and creates documentation in minutes, making the process much more efficient and fun!
